🏠 House Price Prediction — Linear Regression
📋 Objective
Implement and understand Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models to predict house prices.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📈 Workflow
1. Import and Preprocess the Dataset
Downloaded the Housing Price Prediction Dataset.

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Handled missing values (if any) and performed basic data cleaning.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).

Visualized feature distributions using histograms and boxplots.

Created a correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships.

3. Feature Selection
Identified important features correlated with the target variable (Price).

Selected numerical features for the regression model.

4. Train-Test Split
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).

5. Model Building
Used scikit-learn’s LinearRegression to fit the model.

Built both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models.

6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared Score (R²)

Interpreted the model coefficients to understand feature importance.

7. Visualization
Plotted the Regression Line for simple regression.

Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices to assess model fit.

📊 Key Takeaways
Understood the steps to implement Linear Regression from scratch.

Learned to evaluate regression models using appropriate error metrics.

Visualized model performance and made feature-level inferences.

Prepared the dataset correctly for machine learning projects in real-world scenarios.

📌 Future Improvements
Apply feature scaling (normalization/standardization) to improve model convergence.

Explore Regularized Regression (Lasso, Ridge) for better feature selection.

Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for robust evaluation.
